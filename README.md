# Score-Prediction-Based-on-Customer-s-Text : Amazon Food Review Sentiment Analysis

The user is ordering some food.
There is a column called score and we have to predict for different customer's sentiments. This judgement is based on the column
called Text.
Also we have to find what is the upvoting of the that particular customer depending upon what is his sentiment, what does he feels
and all the features based on that.

At the end we have to build such a model that can do prediction, mainly on the behaviour of that particular customer. What can be
sentiments of that particular customer.

It is a type of classification algorithm.
